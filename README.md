# TemplateArtification
A library for template-like image augmentation for segmentation problems.

The paper describing this approach was published in Computers&Geosciences journal, a preprint available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359201303_Core_box_image_recognition_and_its_improvement_with_a_new_augmentation_technique).

It is an improved cut-mix method adopted for segmentation problems.

To test the augmentation, do python3 artification.py
